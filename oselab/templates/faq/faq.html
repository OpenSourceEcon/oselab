  {{
    faq_question(
      question="""
        Will the camp sponsor a student visa?
      """,
      answer="""
        No. The OSE Lab and the University of Chicago cannot provide visa sponsorship for\
        international students. Students can travel under an F1, J1, or B1 sisa. Stipends for international students with F1 or J1 visas will have 14% tax withheld. Students with B1 visas will have 30% withholding. Some of you may be able to get those withheld amounts refunded after the camp based on specific tax treaties in place between the United States and your respective countries. However, many countries do not have tax treaties for scholarship income. We have tax experts in the University of Chicago financial office who you can talk to when you arrive.

        Can I have my recommender send my letter of recommendation directly to OSE Lab?
      """,
      answer='''
        Yes. If your recommender will not give you the letter to upload to the application\
        portal, you can have your recommender e-mail the letter to Richard Evans
        ([rwevans@uchicago.edu](mailto:rwevans@uchicago.edu)). Make sure your recommender puts\
        your name and "OSE camp letter of recommendation."

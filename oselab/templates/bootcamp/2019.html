    The OSE Lab Boot Camp helps build advanced computational skills for economic
    research and policy analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Social Sciences Division at the University of Chicago is pleased to
    announce the third year of the Open Source Economics Laboratory (OSE Lab),
    which will run an intensive and immersive six-week computational economics
    Boot Camp from July 1 to August 9, 2019.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      The goals of the Boot Camp are to:
    </strong>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      train advanced undergraduates and graduate students with the computational
      skills to participate in cutting-edge economic research and public policy
      analysis
    </li>
    <li>
      inspire the brightest young researchers to pursue policy-relevant research
      throughout their careers
    </li>
    <li>
      spread ideals of transparency and replicability throughout the economics
      profession from the ground up
    </li>
    <li>
      accelerate scientific progress in economics and policy analysis more
      broadly through modern collaborative workflows
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Applications to the OSE Lab Boot Camp are encouraged from talented and
    motivated advanced undergraduate students and graduate students, with 25
    fully funded student slots available for summer 2019. Funding includes
    travel to and from the University of Chicago, housing at the University, and
    a stipend of $4,000 for the six weeks. Successful applicants will have taken
    courses or demonstrate proficiency in core microeconomic theory (constrained
    optimization with Lagrangian multipliers), linear algebra, multivariable
    calculus, real analysis, and writing code in some programming language.
  </p>

  <h3 class="mt-5">Program details</h3>

  <p>
    The curriculum of this program includes advanced mathematics, economic
    theory, machine learning, and computational methods, all with a focus on
    open source languages, collaboration, and exposition. Programming at the
    Boot Camp will be mostly in Python. We will also use the collaborative open
    source platforms of git and GitHub extensively. The previous two summers'
    curriculum materials are available in the
    <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceEcon/BootCamp2018">BootCamp2018</a>
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceEcon/BootCamp2017">BootCamp2017</a>
    GitHub repositories.
  </p>

  <p>
    The OSE Lab Boot Camp curriculum will draw from open source curriculum
    developed by the OSE Lab instructors as well as the resources of
    <a href="https://quantecon.org">QuantEcon.org</a> produced by Thomas Sargent
    and John Stachurski. We will also use an extensive set of applied
    mathematics open source training modules and computational labs from the
    Brigham Young University Applied and Computational Math Emphasis (ACME).
    Student researchers who complete the OSE Lab Boot Camp will emerge with a
    rich set of computational tools, experience in successfully applying those
    tools to macroeconomic questions, and the ability to collaborate
    effectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most valuable modules in the OSE Lab Boot Camp will be two weeks
    of training in high performance computing and parallel programming using the
    University of Chicago's Midway supercomputing cluster. This training will be
    presented by Simon Scheidegger and translates well to projects on any
    large-scale cluster or cloud computing platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    The director of the OSE Lab is Dr. Richard W. Evans, Associate Director and
    Senior Lecturer in the M.A. Program in Computational Social Science at the
    University of Chicago and steering committee member of QuantEcon. This
    year's Boot Camp is Co-Organized by Richard Evans and
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/simonscheidegger/home">Dr. Simon Scheidegger</a>.
    Simon is Assistant Professor in the Department of Finance at HEC Lausanne.
  </p>
  <p>
    And finally, as a new addition to the OSE Lab Boot Camp curriculum, we are
    pleased to announce that this year's Boot Camp will be the first of the next
    three years of summer camps to include the Econometric Society's Dynamic
    Structural Economics Workshop during the second week of the OSE Lab Boot
    Camp, July 8-12. The Dynamic Structural Economics Workshop week is primarily
    organized by John Rust (Georgetown University), Bertel Schjerning
    (University of Copenhagen), and Fedor Iskhakov (Australia National
    University), Sanjog Misra (University of Chicago, Booth), and Gunter Hitsch
    (University of Chicago, Booth). All OSE Lab students will get to participate
    in the curriculum instruction during the first half of that week, which will
    include discrete choice dynamic programming, structural estimation, and
    dynamic games. Then the students will get to participate in the conference
    that will take place in the last part of the week.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Instructors for this summer's Boot Camp will include:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lars Hansen, University of Chicago</li>
    <li>Felix Kubler, University of Zurich</li>
    <li>John Rust, Georgetown University</li>
    <li>Anthony Smith, Jr., Yale University</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>The deadline to apply is March 8, 2019.</strong></p>

  <p>
    OSE Lab boot camps are currently being postponed until COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. We are also seeking new funding for the boot camp. We are grateful for the generous support of the Charles Koch Foundation and University of Chicago for the first three years of boot camps 2017-2019. OSE Lab will be searching for new funding to host boot camps after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. In the meantime, OSE Lab will continue to support its current research initiatives and student researchers. Thanks to all the students, instructors, and staff who have made the OSE Lab such a stimulating and collaborative network over the last three years. We look forward to continued future developments.
